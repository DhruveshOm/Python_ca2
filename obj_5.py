# Compute and display summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for all numerical columns.

# Identify and visualize outliers in the total sales column using a box plot.

# Calculate the correlation between critic scores and total sales to determine if higher scores lead to more sales.

# Find the most common game genres and plot their distribution.

# Perform a chi-square test to check if there is a significant relationship between game genre and publisher.

# I'll provide Python code that:
# Loads the dataset.
# Extracts a random 10,000-row sample from the 60,000-row dataset.
# Performs all 20 objectives using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
# Here's the complete implementation:
# Data Science Objectives
# This script efficiently extracts a 10,000-row random sample, processes it, and completes all 20 objectives using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy. Let me know if you need modifications or explanations! ðŸš€
