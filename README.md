🎮 Unveiling Insights from 2024’s Global Video Game Sales Data
📊 Data Science Meets Gaming Analytics
Over the past few days, I’ve been diving deep into a dataset of 60,000+ video game entries, applying real-world data science techniques to extract meaningful insights from the world of gaming. Here's a glimpse of what I explored:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preparation
✔ Converted release dates, handled missing values, categorized sales
✔ Created new features like sales percentage and sales category

✅ Descriptive Analytics & Visualizations
📈 Plotted histograms, pie charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps
🏆 Identified top-selling genres and publishers
🎮 Action and Shooter genres dominated global sales
📍 North America led regional sales, followed by PAL and Japan

✅ Trends & Genre Dynamics
📆 Modeled yearly game release frequency
📌 Found peak release years and top-performing game titles
This project not only boosted my hands-on skills in pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, and hypothesis testing, but also helped me see how data science plays a key role in business strategy, marketing, and audience targeting in gaming.
🔗 Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy), Statistical Modeling, EDA
📚 Dataset: Cleaned & sampled version of global game sales data
I'm open to feedback, opportunities, and collaboration in the field of data science, analytics, and game data insights!
